# AI-Driven Risk Prediction Engine for Chronic Care Patients

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and heart failure require continuous monitoring and proactive care. Despite access to vitals, lab results, and medication adherence data, predicting when a patient may deteriorate remains a major challenge. A reliable and explainable AI-driven solution could empower clinicians and care teams to intervene earlier, improve health outcomes, and reduce hospitalization risks.

### Challenge
Design and prototype an AI-driven Risk Prediction Engine that forecasts whether a chronic care patient is at risk of deterioration in the next 90 days. The solution should leverage patient data and provide predictions in a way that is clinician-friendly, explainable, and actionable.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Prediction Model
- **Input**: 30–180 days of patient data including:
  - Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation)
  - Laboratory results (glucose, HbA1c, lipid panels, kidney function)
  - Medication adherence scores
  - Lifestyle logs (activity, diet, sleep)
  - Demographics and medical history
- **Output**: Probability of deterioration within 90 days (0-100%)
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - AUROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic)
  - AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)
  - Calibration plots and Brier score
  - Confusion matrix with sensitivity/specificity
  - F1 score and balanced accuracy

#### 2. Explainability Features
- **Global Explanations**: Overall feature importance across all patients
- **Local Explanations**: Patient-specific risk factors and drivers
- **Presentation**: Simple, clinician-friendly language avoiding technical jargon
- **Visualization**: Clear charts showing factor contributions

#### 3. Dashboard Components

##### Cohort View
- Risk score overview for all patients
- Sortable/filterable patient list
- Risk level categorization (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Alert notifications for high-risk patients
- Summary statistics and trends

##### Patient Detail View
- Individual risk score with confidence intervals
- Historical trend analysis
- Key risk factors breakdown
- Recommended interventions
- Timeline of significant events
- Medication adherence patterns
